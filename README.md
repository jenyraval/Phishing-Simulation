Phishing Simulation mainly aims to increase phishing awareness by providing an intuitive tutorial and customized assessment (without any actual setup - no domain, no infrastructure, no actual email address) to assess people's action on any given situation and gives ability to understand what is the current awareness posture

## What?

 - One of the objective of organizations carrying out red team assessment is to know the weakness in the IT ecosystem which includes people and network. Organization takes every effort to improve there perimeter security and patch the vulnerabilities found but people remains the weakest link. Phishing plays vital role in understanding the security-awareness of employee. 
- Phishing Simulation enables user to understand it without actually performing the 'live' phishing attack, by leveraging the engaging and intuitive training sessions.
- Tool will give you a customized environment to design your test as per your requirements which make questions tailor-made for every organization and unique for each person, close to real-time phishing attack, targeted and difficult to answer, senario based and SMishing questions coverage but all of this without any actual setup. Once test is designed all the targeted audience can take the assessment and submit there answers. We will have a analysis at the end of campaign to understand the current awareness posture.
- All it takes is just one click! So this will make us think twice before we do that one click.

## Why?

- While doing red team assessment it is a daunting task to set up entire phishing campaign. Decide a domain, buy it, setup a phishing website, design an email and choose target audience track the clicks to only know who all clicked them and there awareness.
- This will need time and expertise to set-up. 
- Tool will help you do all this for you just with few clicks (And those clicks are legit and helps you :))
- People are the most unpredictable one's and this tool will help you to know them and pattern of there clicks.

## Features and How to use

Tool have mainly 2 modules:
1. Admin Module : Which has access to setup test and view analysis, can be accessed at at http://localhost/AdminPanel/login.php, default login credentials are admin/admin
